## Facets in ggplot2

Summary: One way to create subplots that display one subset of the data for your categorical variables.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Example: Using mpg dataset. Let's say we want to see the correlation between hwy (highway miles per gallon) and displ(engine displacement, in litres)

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

Now, we want to see how each type of class (type of car) does, we could add it using facets

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
```
